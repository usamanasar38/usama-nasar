My contributions also included building a high-accuracy web scraping solution with Node.js and Puppeteer, achieving an 80% captcha bypass success rate, streamlining data extraction processes, and enhancing automation efficiency. On the front-end, I worked extensively with Angular to transform design mockups into fully interactive, responsive web pages that ensured seamless navigation and visual consistency across devices. I implemented performance optimizations that improved application efficiency by 10%, addressed cross-browser compatibility challenges, and fine-tuned the overall user experience. Additionally, I collaborated with cross-functional teams, provided technical guidance to junior developers, and contributed to the successful delivery of multiple projects within tight deadlines while maintaining high coding standards and best practices.",
